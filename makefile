# This is better makefile for Squirrel, part of General-Purpose Squirrel
# project. The trick is that GNU Make looks for "makefile", then "Makefile",
# so this file overrides upstream Makefile (which is not ideal and laeft in
# place only to make it easier merge with upstream). This however means
# that there may be problems with case-insensitive file systems, so don't
# use such, use FSes with proper POSIX semantics.
#
# This file support specifying compile and link - type options in one places,
# easy overriding of them, and supporting build of different versions of
# targets with different options - in different dirs, using VPATH feature.
